Topic- Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


HTTP is a data communications protocol and acts as the foundation of the World Wide Web. HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol 

HTTP1.1 was created in 1997 and http2 was created on 2015.

In HTTP/2, data is sent all at once, but http1.1 sends the data one by one.

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other where as HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)connection to send multiple streams of data at once.

http2 is faster and more efficient than http1.1

HTTP/2 offers a feature called weighted prioritization which allows the client to decide which contents should given more priority and to be loaded first. 

http1.1 compresses data by itself where as http2 uses HPACK for data compression.

http1.1 gives data to the client only after asking where as http2 push the contents to client even before asking for them. 

HTTP 1.1 uses plain text to encode and transmit data. which is easy to read and understand the data. HTTP 2 uses a series of binary codes to encode and transmit data rather than plain text.
