 Topic - Objects and its internal representation in Javascript


Object is the most important data-type and  it forms the building blocks for JavaScript.

It  may contain any combination of primitive data-types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) and reference data-types.

Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. 

You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation or bracket notation. 

A property name that has a space or a hyphen, or that starts with a number can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.

Both the object name and property name are case sensitive.

Objects are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value that can be used to access it.
